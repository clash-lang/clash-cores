ARP table that stores @2^depth@ entries in block RAM. @maxAgeSeconds@ is the
number of seconds before the entry will be removed from the table (lazily).

Every second, the ARP table is unable to handle insertion and lookup requests
for @2^depth@ clock cycles, because it needs to decrease the timers of the
entries. During this period, the component will assert backpressure. Note
that this implies that the component will not work correctly when the size of
the ARP table is bigger than the clock frequency.

An entry may be evicted sooner than expected from the cache due to hash collisions;
entries are addressed by taking the last @depth@ bits of their corresponding IPv4
address. By increasing the number of entries in the table, the chance of IPv4
addresses colliding is lower. For example, the addresses @10.0.0.1@ and
@192.168.0.1@ will collide if the depth is small.

__NB__: the timeout is inaccurate for up to one second, because the circuit uses a
constant counter for efficiency reasons.
