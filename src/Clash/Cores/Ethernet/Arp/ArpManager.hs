Handles ARP lookup requests by client components. If a lookup IPv4 address is
not found in the ARP table, it will broadcast an ARP request to the local
network and wait at most @maxWaitMs@ milliseconds for a reply. If no reply
was received within time, we signal an 'ArpEntryNotFound' to the lookup channel.

Client components should drop a packet upon receiving 'ArpEntryNotFound' in
order to avoid stalling the network stack any further.

__NB__: the timer does not support clock frequencies slower than 2 Hz.

Transmits ARP packets upon request by creating a full 'ArpPacket' from the
input 'ArpLite' and packetizing that into a new packet stream. Uses
'packetizeFromDfC' internally to achieve this, and therefore inherits all of
its properties related to latency and throughput.

Because ARP's EtherType and our MAC address are known globally, we do not add
it to the metadata here, only the target MAC address. This makes this circuit
more flexible, because then the top-level ARP circuit decides where to add this
metadata to the stream, allowing for cheaper potential buffers between components.

{- |
Parses the incoming packet stream into an @ArpPacket@, validates whether this
is a correct IPv4 to Ethernet ARP packet and then throws away all the redundant
information to create either an ARP entry or an ARP (lite) response:

- Outputs ARP entries for any gratuitous ARP packets (@TPA == SPA@) and
  ARP replies (@OPER == 2@).
- Outputs ARP (lite) responses for ARP requests (@OPER == 1@) where
  @TPA@ is our IPv4 address.

Uses 'depacketizeToDfC' internally to do the parsing, so all padding will be
consumed and packets will be dropped if they were aborted.

Assumes that the input stream is either a broadcast or directed towards us, and
that it is routed by the ARP EtherType.
