-- | Converts a @PacketStream@ of a Record into separate operations for the
-- @WishboneMaster@.
-- It also bypasses the @WishboneMaster@ with the @RecordHeader@ so that the
-- @RecordBuilder@ does not have to wait for the wishbone bus to start
-- constructing the response. The bypass line also holds the @BaseRetAddr@
-- required in the response in the case of reads, and an abort signal.
--
-- This circuit makes use of the fact that the depacketizers set @_abort@ for
-- the rest of a packet if it was toggled. This means that there is no need to
-- have an additional state to handle aborts.
--
-- This circuit assumes that @_last@ is set to @maxBound@ with the final
-- fragment of a packet.
