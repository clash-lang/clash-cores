-- | Vector containing the two alternative forms (with opposite running
--   disparity) of K28.5. This is the only relevant comma, as the other commas
--   are set as "reserved" in the list of control words. The order of the commas
--   in this is important, as the first comma returns the negative running
--   disparity when it is decoded and the second comma returns the positive
--   running disparity when it is decoded. This is used in 'Sync.LossOfSync' to
--   recover the correct running disparity from a received comma.
