--   __TODO__: The state diagram shows that in the state @ABILITY_DETECT@ the
--   acknowledge bit should be set to zero. However, if this is done, the PHY
--   does not always (~50% of the time) exit auto-negotiation mode, which means
--   that no data can be transmitted. This can be resolved by resetting the PCS
--   receive. The documentation for SGMII, specifically Table 1, shows that the
--   acknowledge bit of the configuration register is always asserted, that is
--   why here the decision has been made to remove this deassertion to zero in
--   @ABILITY_DETECT@. Now the PHY does correctly exit auto-negotiation mode,
--   and the configuration register will be transmitted correctly. However, due
--   to the lack of a description of specific changes in the documentation, it
--   is not clear whether this is indeed the correct solution, and it should be
--   investigated further.
